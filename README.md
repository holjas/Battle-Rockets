# Welcome to Battle Rockets! ðŸš€ ðŸš€

Thanks for checking out Battle Rockets, a game where 2 players can play a Battleship-like game - featuring rockets! Created using React, Firebase and CSS.

Featuring the SpaceX Rockets API, players can choose their roster of Rockets from a number of real life launched rockets. The choice of rocket is complemented by stats about each rocket, and corresponds to the size of rockets needed to play Battle Rockets.

State of the game reside on the server (in our case, firebase) and the players get to know whever there is a change in the state.

This project was created for Juno College of Technology in Toronto, to show an understanding of core React concepts as applied to larger applications. Thanks for visiting!
